# unPOFMA

Hide POFMA Correction Directives. Just because.

# What does this do?

This extension hides POFMA notices issued in accordance with Singapore's [POFMA regulations](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL-Supp/S662-2019/Published/20191001?DocDate=20191001#pr1-).

The extension analyzes the content of pages you visit and replaces POFMA notices with a 'POFMA' button, or any other text as configured in the options panel. All analysis is done entirely within your browser; no browsing data (or any other data) is sent to any servers to ensure your privacy. No information is collected at all.

Code for this extension is [open-source](https://github.com/jianxiong/unPOFMA).
